- **`--dry-run` mode** to preview file organization actions without making changes
- **`--help` flag** displays CLI usage instructions and supported options
- **Conflict resolution**: files with the same name but different content are renamed with a timestamp + short hash to prevent overwriting
- **Duplicate detection**: identical files (based on SHA256 hash) are skipped to avoid redundant moves

  - Log entries include timestamps, log levels (`INFO`, `DRY RUN`, `ERROR`), and action details
- **Undo mechanism**:

  - Supports both `MOVED` and `RENAMED` reversals
  - Prompts user for confirmation before each undo
  - Skips missing files and clears undo log after reversal
- **Filename sanitization**: trims leading and trailing whitespace from all file names before moving
- **Auto-creation of destination folders** if they donâ€™t already exist
- **MIT License** added for open-source clarity
